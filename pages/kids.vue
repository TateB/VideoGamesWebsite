    <p>Kids and Adults have fundamentally different views on video games, in the case of violence the negative aspects are focused on and everything else is ignored giving the impression that the video game is nothing but the bad aspects.</p>
    <p>“Parents and children can have different ideas when it comes to video games. Children like video games because they are fun and because they can be challenging. You have to solve problems, work out the best moves for your character, and decide how to use your equipment and supplies in the best possible way. Making all these decisions can be exciting. Parents want to make sure that their children are safe and healthy. Because of this, they notice different things about video games. Many worry that playing video games might have a bad effect on the way their child behaves. For example, if a video game has lots of fighting in it, they worry that playing it will encourage their child to be violent.” - Joanne Orlando</p>
