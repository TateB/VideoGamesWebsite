    <h2>Our Research</h2>
    <p>For the experiment children were asked to answer a questionnaire involving situations that may involve violent behaviour. Both children had answered the questionnaire as expected, avoiding violent or confrontational answers. Afterwards both children, aged 7-9 both a boy and a girl, were exposed to a violent video game (Bookworm adventures the word forming puzzle video game for microsoft windows) for a short period of time (15-20 minutes). Children had previously not displayed any violent characteristics and had not been influenced to act a certain way in the results by the experimenters. After exposure, both children were asked to answer the questionnaire a second time.</p>
    <p>The male subject was unaffected by the video game as both questionnaire answers taken before and after exposure gave similar responses, in which non-aggression and “Working it out” was prioritised. The female subject was more significantly affected by video games, answering the questionnaire prioritising active effort and or more violent methods, behaviour afterwards was observed to be more irritable and short tempered.</p>
