    <h2>Video Game Companies</h2>
    <img src="videogamecompanies.jpg">
    <p>Blame is often placed on major video game companies, saying that by creating and actively distributing these video games, they are at fault, although almost all these claims have been exclusively made in the US. The major companies involved (listed above) have not publicly responded to these claims in any significant way. This may be due to the companies views on the issue itself, suggesting that they do not view it as a legitimate issue, or controversy around it and their attempts to avoid it.</p>
